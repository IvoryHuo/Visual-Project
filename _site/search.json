    "text": "Public transport is an imperative part of an infrastructure as millions of people use public transport system for their daily commute. In Singapore, about 70% of the population use public transport (bus/MASS rapid transport/light-rail transit). The public transportation system provides services to commuters’ various routes (Chua & Wang, 2020). The trips they make provide us with enormous amount of commuting data points of interest including information on origin, destination, time of travel, distance travelled, and location of travel. We can gain insights on commuters’ behaviours and travelling patterns by analysing such datapoints.\nIn this study, we will focus on Singapore public bus transport and explore the data about passenger volume through bus trips at bus stop, subzone, and planning area level. We plan to run various models such as Gravity Model, Linear Mixed Model, Regression, and Clustering. The insights generated on public commuting will allow us to have an integrated view of the flow of people in different subzones, the time of the trips, and the primary factors that most influence the patterns of commuting."

    "text": "Motivation\nThe digital age has allowed us to have access to large amounts of data. With EZ-Link cards as well as credit and debit cards tapping in and out, we can collect the origin and destination information of commuters. By analysing this information, the relevant authorities can make decisions that are data-backed rather than intuition.\nThe availability of such data provides us with an opportunity to work on information that is current. By integrating geospatial data with aspatial information will allows us to run different models to gain insights on passenger flow patterns. However, little research has been conducted using public bus commute information of Singapore. Appropriate data analysis and insights can be pertinent for the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and urban planners to plan new bus routes, upgrade and maintain the existing ones, resolve logjams, and allocate budgets to carry out these tasks. Furthermore, these insights can also support policy formulation and decision making for development plans in the future. It is thus important and necessary to interpret information from these trips and turn the data into statistical insights that can reveal the key factors affecting the patterns of commuting flows."

Each trip’s information describes its original bus stop, destination bus stop, passenger’s entry timestamp (in hour) and whether on weekdays or weekends/holidays. An example of Oct 2022 passenger bus commuting data is as shown.\n\nMoreover, we have 5 other datasets contain the information of each bus stop, each subzone, each planning area, each region of Singapore as well as the distance between each subzone. Four of the data sets are spatial data sets.\n\n\n\nSG bus stop locations\n\n\nIn bus stop dataset, we are interested in which subzone it belongs to, and the geo-spatial location(longitude and latitude) of each bus stop.\nIn subzone dataset, we are interested in subzone area and its land-use description such as residential, commercial, business, and etc, and the geo-spatial location of each subzone.\nIn distance dataset, we have the distance between each subzone in matrix."
